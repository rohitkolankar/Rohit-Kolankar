            <p><strong>Nowadays we see on OTT every upcoming series is based on either mythology or just targetting one community. So the targetted community is none other than ‘The Hindu’ community. Because we hindu’s are silent on the things which are happening around us which goes against the hindu community, our sanatan sanskriti, our ancestors, our festivals and many such things.B ut this is only happening with one community cause if they utter a single word or if they show something bad about the particular community they know people will not sit silent on their actions and at the end they will have to take step back.
<br><br>But now it’s high time ,we have to wake up because adharma is getting stronger. We see everyday our temples are getting demolished, our sisters are being killed, our brothers who are taking stand for our community are being murdered,etc. It’s not going on a right track.

Our ancestors fought for many years to save our sanatan sanskriti. Bhagwa is our pride. They considered Saffron as their Guru and fought with each and everyone who were trying to make this bharat mata as their own property.But our ancestors were so great that they did not allow this to happen.At the end this Bhagwa dhwaj is the only identity we people have.And we should respect it.
So we youth have to take stand for our oldest sanatan sanskriti. Louder your voice against the thing which is happening around you which is spreading fake propogandas about your community. Be proud that You Born Hindu!<br><br>
Jai shree ram!!❤<br><br>
